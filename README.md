## Overview
The hybrid app development in lately is growing so fast in popularity. There are Ionic, React Native, and Flutter. These technologies share a common vision of creating beautiful, high-performance apps that work everywhere.

In this documentation, we want to show you the comparation of Ionic, React Native, and Flutter in single monorepo. In this repository, there are examples of application for each framework.

We setup this monorepo using [Nx](https://nx.dev/) and we are excited to using this one.


## Installation
Of course, you also can read our documentation of installation [here](docs/INSTALLATION.md)


## Ionic
### Pros of Ionic
- Single codebase to build web, mobile, and desktop
- Development Experience is closely similar with Web Development Experience
- Don't need to learn more language, just choose one of our favorite web framework react or angular.
- Can build app to Mobile, Desktop, Web, and PWA
- Using Standards-based Web Components
- Web performance is Excellent
- Pre-built components
- Performance is faster and interactive apps
- Using Tech Stack such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript

### Cons of Ionic
- Mobile performance is not better than Flutter
- Dependent to using many libraries for development

## React Native
### Pros of React Native
- Using Javascript (React)
- Built-in components
- Native-like apps

### Cons of React Native
- Cannot to build the codebase to Web or Desktop
- Too much dependent to external libraries


## Flutter
### Pros of Flutter
- Ready-to-use widgets, APIs, and its own rendering engine that helps in building beautiful, high-performance cross-platform applications.
- Graphically enhanced apps that are high performing
- Type-safe
- Having a large community, and still growing in popularity
- Have command-line tools
- Produces a native app for the iOS or Android device
- Have extensions for easier code in some code editors like VSCode, Android Studio. So the development process can be pretty fast.
- Possible to write Android, iOS, and even Web app
- Has a great potential to take the industry
- User interface is The Best


### Cons of Flutter
- Need to learn Dart language
- Must installed flutter first in device
- Web Performance is Poor than another technologies above
- Have a good documentation and many examples
- Less popular than the another above


## Conclusion
Ionic’s guiding principle is to use the web platform and embrace open standards wherever possible. When we build with Ionic, we will learn and apply the tools and languages of the web, using a framework designed to deliver great performance on mobile, desktop, and especially, the web.

Flutter, in contrast, has chosen to go it alone, creating a self-contained ecosystem that is at odds with the common languages, toolsets, and standards found in the broader hybrid app development world. Thus, if we choose Flutter, we will be learning the Flutter way of doing things. Of course, there are clear benefits to a custom architecture that has one single purpose, as we’ve seen in some of their impressive early demos.

Ionic is very popular as it eliminates the learning a new language factor whereas Flutter needs the developers to learn Dart programming language in order to build cross-platform apps. Although, when it comes to building highly graphical apps, Ionic is never the first choice of the app developers, React Native comes into play then. Flutter is new compared to Ionic and React Native but is soon getting the recognition it deserves.

### So with this comparation. we can decide to choose Ionic when our business required to:
- Faster development. Because, we dont need to learn language anymore, if we already understand HTML, CSS, Javascript (React or Angular)
- need to build mobile, desktop and web in more efficiency way
- also need to build Great Performance of Web

### Choose React Native if the business is required to:
- Buid a native-like application
- Don't need to build Desktop

### Choose Flutter if the business is required to:
- High performance mobile applications
- Very interactive mobile applications
- Invest for the future for mobile application
- Build smaller application than another hybrid tech
